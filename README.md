# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine how the Pyber ridesharing data differs by city type (i.e., urban, suburban and rural cities) and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer ([analysis](https://github.com/rabascoh/rideshare-analysis/blob/main/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)). 

## Results

The following differences were observed by city type. Please see the summary table and chart below for reference. 

### Total Rides
  * Urban cities lead for total rides followed by suburban cities and then rural cities. 

### Total Drivers
  * Urban cities also lead for total drivers followed by suburban cities and then rural cities. 

### Total Fares
  * Urban cities also lead for total fares followed by suburban cities and then rural cities. 
  
### Average Fare per Ride
  * Rural cities lead for the highest average rate per ride followed by suburban cities and then urban cities. 

### Average Fare per Driver
  * Rural cities also lead for the highest average fare per driver followed by suburban cities and then urban cities. 

### Total Fare by City Type
  * For January 2019 to April 2019 urban cities lead with the highest total fares every month followed by suburban cities and then rural cities. 
  * Urban fares peaked in late February and early March. 
  * Suburban fares peaked in late February and increased again at the end of April.
  * Rural fares peaked in late February and increased again in early April.

## Summary
Following the analysis, we recommend the following to address disparities among city types. 
1. **Increase Fare per Ride for Urban Cities:** Although urban cities lead for total fares, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride. To increase the total fares, we recommend increasing the average fare per ride for urban cities.  
2. **Increase Fare per Driver for Urban Cities:** The average fare per driver is substantially lower for urban cities as compared to suburban and rural cities. We recommend increasing the fare for urban drivers to match those in suburban and rural cities.   
3. **Increase Rural Coverage:** Rural cities have the highest average fares per ride. We recommend further investing in rural cities to increase the total rides and drive the total fares for rural cities.
